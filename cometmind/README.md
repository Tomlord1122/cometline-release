# CometMind

> A local, session-first **general AI agent runtime**. CometMind is the brain — it reasons, plans, remembers, and acts through a pluggable tool layer, and delegates coding work to specialized coding agents (OpenCode, Claude Code, etc.) over **ACP**.

This directory is one module inside the `cometline` monorepo. The historical standalone `cometmind` repo is archived; current development, issues, and pull requests land in the monorepo root.

CometMind is the middle tier of the Cometline stack:

```
comet-sdk   →  provider-agnostic LLM I/O (Anthropic, OpenAI, Codex, compatible APIs)
cometmind   →  general agent brain: agent loop + tools + memory + persistence + HTTP/SSE + CLI
  └─ ACP ──→  opencode / claude-code (coding specialist, invoked via delegate_coding_task)
cometline   →  Electron desktop shell (also starts CometMind as a sidecar)
```

## What it is

CometMind started as a coding-focused agent and is now a **general-purpose orchestrator**:

- The runtime owns **reasoning, planning, semantic memory, skills, and tool orchestration**.
- **Coding tasks are delegated** to an external ACP-speaking agent instead of being hardcoded into the runtime.
- The same agent loop powers the **desktop app**, the **CLI**, and the **Discord gateway**.
- Built-in workspace tools cover file I/O, shell commands, web fetch, and skill management.

CometMind still has a clear runtime boundary inside the product: it owns the CLI, config, database, and localhost HTTP/SSE API. But in practice it is now tightly coupled to Cometline's product workflow and monorepo development model. It should be read as an internal first-party runtime, not as a separately evolving project.

## Architecture

```

### Agent loop

The runner iterates up to `max_steps` (default 50):

1. **Retrieve memories** (when enabled) → inject into system prompt → emit `memory_injected`.
2. Rebuild the conversation from SQLite → call the provider via `llm.StreamMessage`.
3. Stream SDK events → translate to CometMind `event.Event` and push to the caller.
4. Persist token usage and the assistant step (reasoning + tool-call shells).
5. If there are tool calls: execute each via `Registry.Execute`, record duration/exit, persist the tool result, and emit `tool_result`.
6. Stop when `finish_reason` is `stop`/`max_tokens`, or when there are no tool calls.
7. **Extract memories** after the turn (when enabled) → emit `memory_updated`.

### Built-in tools

Registered per workspace in `internal/tools/registry.go`:

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `read_file` | Read UTF-8 text under the workspace root |
| `write_file` | Create or overwrite a file; mkdir parents |
| `list_dir` | Non-recursive directory listing |
| `glob` | Find files by glob pattern (`**` supported); gitignore-aware, capped at 100 |
| `grep` | Search file contents (ripgrep when available); gitignore-aware |
| `run_command` | Shell in workspace cwd (120s timeout, denylist for dangerous commands) |
| `web_fetch` | HTTP(S) fetch with HTML→text; SSRF protection |
| `load_skill` | Load full `SKILL.md` for a discovered skill |
| `read_skill_file` | Read auxiliary files inside a skill directory |
| `write_skill` | Create or update a skill under `~/.cometmind/skills/{name}/` |
| `delegate_coding_task` | Spawn an ACP child session (sync or async) |

File tools are workspace-scoped through `internal/tools/sandbox/pathcheck.go`.

### ACP delegation

When the model calls `delegate_coding_task`, CometMind spawns an external coding agent (default: `opencode acp`) and streams progress back through the same SSE pipeline:

- Child sessions are persisted with `parent_session_id`, delegation status, and ACP session ID.
- ACP permission prompts are handled automatically by selecting an allow-style option when available.

Configure in Settings → CometMind → ACP, persisted in `~/.cometmind/cometline-settings.json` (legacy `config.toml` is read only when JSON settings are missing):

```toml
[acp]
command = "opencode"
args = ["acp"]
timeout = "30m"
```

### Semantic memory

CometMind stores durable facts, preferences, and project notes in SQLite with embedding-based retrieval:

- **Auto-retrieve** before each turn (top-k by cosine similarity).
- **Auto-extract** after each turn via a structured LLM JSON pass.
- **Compaction** decays stale memories, forgets low-weight entries, and merges clusters when over `max_memories`.
- Embedding uses an OpenAI-compatible endpoint (default model: `text-embedding-3-small`).

Memory is configured under `[memory]` in config and exposed through REST (see API below). Cometline renders injected memories in the chat UI and provides a full memory settings panel.

### Storage & retention

Session and archived-memory cleanup runs once when CometMind starts (sidecar restart after saving General settings in Cometline). Configure under `cometmind.storage` in `cometline-settings.json` (or legacy `[storage]` in `config.toml` / `COMETMIND_STORAGE_*` env overrides):

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `retentionDays` | 90 | Delete sessions with no activity for N days; `0` disables |
| `maxSessionsPerWorkspace` | 0 | Keep only the M most recently updated sessions per workspace; `0` disables |
| `archivedMemoryPurgeDays` | 90 | Hard-delete archived memories older than N days; `0` disables |
| `vacuumAfterPurge` | `true` | Run SQLite `VACUUM` after deletions to reclaim disk |

Deleting a session also removes its Discord channel mapping (`gateway_sessions`); the next message in that channel starts a fresh session.

### Agent Skills

CometMind discovers skills from standard install locations and injects a compact index into the system prompt:

- `~/.cometmind/skills`
- `<workspace>/.agents/skills`
- `<workspace>/.claude/skills`
- `~/.config/opencode/skills`
- `~/.claude/skills`

The model loads full instructions on demand via `load_skill` / `read_skill_file`. Cometline and Discord expose `/create-skill` to author new skills.

```bash
npx skills add vercel-labs/agent-skills -g -a opencode -a claude-code
go run . skills list
go run . skills sync
```

```toml
[skills]
enabled = true
roots = []
include_opencode = true
include_claude = true
mirror_to_cometmind = false
```

### Discord gateway

CometMind can run as a Hermes-style messaging gateway. Discord is the first supported platform.

```bash
go run . gateway run --platform discord
```

Features: allowlisted users/channels, `@mention` gating, per-thread sessions, typing indicators, reply chunking, `/thread` and `/create-skill` slash commands.

See [`docs/GATEWAY.md`](docs/GATEWAY.md) for setup.

Session list examples:

```bash
cometmind session list                              # current workspace
cometmind session list -w /path/to/repo             # explicit workspace path
cometmind session list --workspace-id <uuid>        # by workspace id
cometmind session list --all                        # all workspaces (sidebar-equivalent)
cometmind session list --all --json                 # machine-readable output
```

## Configuration

Settings live at `~/.cometmind/cometline-settings.json` (shared with Cometline). The SQLite database is at `~/.cometmind/cometmind.db`.

Set `COMETMIND_DATA_DIR` to relocate the settings file, database, MCP OAuth tokens, and process metadata into a different directory for container or managed-service deployments.

Runtime apply semantics:

- `cometmind settings reload` re-reads the settings file and applies safe in-process changes for new work.
- Memory settings, memory provider swaps, storage cleanup interval changes, job reconcile interval changes, bind host or port changes, Discord token changes, and fresh environment variable values still require restart.
- `cometmind process restart` stops the target process and relaunches it using its recorded command arguments. It waits up to 10 seconds for a clean exit before force-killing, then re-execs the same binary with the same flags.

If `cometline-settings.json` is missing but legacy `config.toml` exists, CometMind loads the TOML once and logs a migration hint. New installs get a minimal JSON template from `cometmind init` / first `Load()`.

Environment overrides use the `COMETMIND_` prefix (dots become underscores). Provider API keys fall back to `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, or `COMETMIND_API_KEY`.

Example JSON shape (Cometline writes the full file from Settings):

```json
{
  "providers": [
    {
      "id": "my-gateway",
      "name": "Company Gateway",
      "method": "openai-compatible",
      "enabled": true,
      "baseURL": "https://gateway.example.com/v1",
      "apiKey": "...",
      "enabledModels": ["gpt-4o"],
      "models": ["gpt-4o"],
      "selectedModel": "gpt-4o"
    }
  ],
  "activeProviderId": "my-gateway",
  "cometmind": {
    "systemPromptPath": "/path/to/SOUL.md",
    "memory": { "embedding": { "providerId": "", "model": "" } },
    "storage": {
      "retentionDays": 90,
      "maxSessionsPerWorkspace": 0,
      "archivedMemoryPurgeDays": 90,
      "vacuumAfterPurge": true
    }
  }
}
```

Legacy `config.toml` (still read for migration):

```toml
provider = "anthropic"
model = "claude-sonnet-4-5"
base_url = ""
max_tokens = 8192
max_steps = 50
system_prompt_path = ""

[[providers]]
id = "my-gateway"
name = "Company Gateway"
method = "openai-compatible"
base_url = "https://gateway.example.com/v1"
api_key = "..."
model = "gpt-4o"

[memory]
enabled = true
auto_extract = true
auto_retrieve = true

[gateway.discord]
enabled = false
bot_token_env = "DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN"
allowed_users = []
allowed_channels = []
require_mention = true
workspace_path = "/path/to/workspace"
```

When Cometline is running, Settings writes `~/.cometmind/cometline-settings.json`; CometMind reads that same file on startup.

## Database

SQLite schema (version 7) includes:

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `workspaces` | Registered workspace roots |
| `sessions` | Conversations with model/provider, token usage, delegation fields |
| `messages` | User, assistant, tool result, and system rows (multimodal content) |
| `tool_calls` | Tool-call shells plus execution output and timing |
| `gateway_sessions` | Maps external chat surfaces to CometMind sessions |
| `memories` | Semantic memories with embeddings and lifecycle metadata |
| `memory_events` | Audit log for memory changes |

After schema or query changes, run `sqlc generate` and add incremental migrations in `internal/db/migrate.go`.

## Build & run

```bash
# From cometmind/
go build ./...
go test ./...

go run . init
go run . serve --port 7700

# One CLI turn scoped to the current workspace
go run . chat "hello"
```

From the monorepo root:

```bash
make dev      # build CometMind + launch Cometline Electron app
make check    # SDK tests + CometMind tests + Svelte checks
make package  # build sidecar + package Electron app
```

Requires Go 1.25+. `comet-sdk` is consumed via `replace github.com/cometline/comet-sdk => ../comet-sdk`.

CometMind is not versioned or released independently today, and the current documentation should assume monorepo-first development rather than future standalone distribution.

## Closed-loop self-improvement

Register this repo as the workspace (`go run . init` from the monorepo root or open it in Cometline), then ask CometMind to improve Cometline. It can call `delegate_coding_task` to hand coding to OpenCode, review test output in the parent session, and iterate.

Example verify command: `cd cometmind && go test ./...`
