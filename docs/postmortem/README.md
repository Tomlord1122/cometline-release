# Postmortems

Short write-ups of non-obvious bugs in the Cometline UI layer: symptoms, root cause, fix, and how to avoid regressions. Read these before changing `chat.svelte.ts`, `reducers/chat.ts`, `ChatView.svelte`, or `ChatThread.svelte`.

## When to add a postmortem

Add one when:

- The bug was caused by Svelte reactivity, transitions, or keyed `{#each}` behavior
- The fix is non-obvious without reading the component tree
- A future refactor could easily reintroduce the same failure mode
